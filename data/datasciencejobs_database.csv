81953194,2/29/2020,Startup wants me to pay for their product before they ve even hired meSo  I m through to the last of a 4 stage interview with a media company  One of the founders I spoke to has suggested that I can subscribe to their product  with a 50  discount   To me it seems a little bit stingy that they wouldn t offer it to me for free  at least as a trial   They have mentioned it a few times throughout the process and so I am starting to wonder if they re implying I won t get the job otherwise  From what I can tell  they don t have a huge userbase  Anyone else experienced this   EDIT Huge thanks to all the comments  Didn t expect this much response ,United States

82017709,2/29/2020,Startup wants me to pay for their product before they ve even hired me So  I m through to the last of a 4 stage interview with a media company  One of the founders I spoke to has suggested that I can subscribe to their product  with a 50  discount   To me it seems a little bit stingy that they wouldn t offer it to me for free  at least as a trial   They have mentioned it a few times throughout the process and so I am starting to wonder if they re implying I won t get the job otherwise  From what I can tell  they don t have a huge userbase  Anyone else experienced this   EDIT Huge thanks to all the comments  Didn t expect this much response ,United States
